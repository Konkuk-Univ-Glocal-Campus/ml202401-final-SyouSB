Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house.

The blend called Chinese Restaurant Tea is a blend of green, oolong and jasmine. It doesn't contain ginseng or black tea, which might explain why some people don't like it. (Black tea is more common and smoother tasting than green, which can be grassy or sharp tasting.) It does taste like the teas I have had at better Asian restaurants. (Some of the cheapo ones don't even serve tea any more.)I like the packaging and the name. Kind of quirky, stripped down and charming to my mind. It is hard for me to find this tea in stores. I called the company and they said it was only available in certain regions. (My store had carried it but stopped apparently due to this regional issue -- no longer available in our part of PA.) It was much cheaper in the store than it is on-line but I am just glad to have found it! Thanks for carrying it, Amazon and friends!","Tasty blend of green, jasmine and oolong tea.

It's a green tea mixed with Ginseng, and they've added licorice root to perhaps sweeten the tea. I don't even add any sugar or honey to it, the taste is that good. My only complaint is that the box claims it is 100 natural, but I wish they would disclose the amount and type of Ginseng. I bought this tea because of the Ginseng, so it would be nice if they disclosed what type of Ginseng and what concentration of it is in the tea itself. Since this is a pretty inexpensive tea, I'm guessing it's a cheap low-quality Ginseng, but like I said, it is tasty. Another nice benefit of this tea is that you can just drop the tea bag into a glass of room temperature water and drink it that way, it's very tasty this way! You don't have to steep or brew it with hot water, so it makes it a nice drinkable tea year round.","Good taste, but is it real Ginseng",Food & Beverage,Beverages,Wine,Beer & Liquor,Beer,Food,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

Previously, I had purchased a single pack of the Citrus Green Tea, from a specialty shop. It was so incredible... I wish I had bought about 10 packs of it.Upon reading reviews, I thought the Classic Iced Tea might be to my liking as well. I am not a big fan of green tea latte, but thought that I should give it a try, since other people raved about it so much. I was right. The Green Tea Latte was my least favorite of the three. It reminded me a little of green tea ice cream. Okay once in a while, but not an every day treat for me. I prefer the crisp/clear taste, over the creamy/milky flavor. Just personal preference.Now, I simply cannot decide which of the other 2 flavors I love more. They are so incredible tasting, and smooth textured. I love both the astringency and the acidity. They are perfectly balanced, and the flavors play like a melody on the palate. If I could, I would order a case of each of them... just so I could have them on hand all the time. They are by far, my favorite candy, bar none. No pun intended. :)*Note to sellers, I refuse to pay 5 or 6 shipping on a single 1.99 bag of candy. This is absolutely ludicrous. Get real!

"Food,Beverages,Beer, Wine & Spirits,Spirits,grocery","Gosling's Diet Ginger Beer, 12 fl oz",,"I received a case of Goslings diet ginger beer today. I had such high hopes for this product because this would be this first reasonably priced diet ginger beer that I could ship to my home that I have actually heard of (I had previously bought a case of Royalty diet ginger beer at Amazon, but I had never heard of the brand before buying it). I knew Goslings has a good reputation among Ginger Beers, so I had an expectation that I might have found a better diet ginger beer. Sadly, I was mistakenI tried this product in three blind taste tests with Royalty diet ginger beer as my alternative. In each of the three tests, I had a strong preference for Royalty. I found Goslings diet ginger beer to be overly sweet and syrupy, lacking in strong ginger flavor, and completely devoid of that spicy ginger bite that true ginger beer fans expect. Goslings diet ginger beer also has an unpleasant aftertaste that serves as a fitting exclamation point to this products mediocrity.I have had worse ginger beers. Saranac and Reeds come to mind. That said, Goslings diet ginger beer is simply an inferior product. When the price of this soda is similar to the diet ginger beers from Royalty or Barritts (for those who are lucky enough to have access to it), there is simply no reason to purchase Goslings diet ginger beer.Please note: I have used this product as a diet ginger beer, which I consumed plain or over ice.

Despite my reservations, I ordered the kit and in a few days a USPS box arrived at my house. I opened the box and found that there was no fluff, no boxed kit, there were just ingredients (partial mash) and instructions. The 6 pound pouch of DME and other pouches had handwritten on it what it was and when to use them. Admittedly I wrinkled my nose and thought what the hell is this. Brew day came and went and I had no problems with making the wort, everything went smooth. Eight days go by and I find that the FG reading on the batch is where I want it to be so I bottled 51 bottles of beer to condition.Fast forward 7 days now. I opened one to test it out. This beer turned out really good. The dark red color of the batch hails to it being a true Irish Red. The beer has a slightly malty flavor with subtle hints of caramel notes to it. It's not overly hoppy (which I detest in beers). I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat.As a note to other people who may buy this, I enjoy darker, stouter beers. This might have better results if you thin the wort out by adding an extra 1/2 gallon or so of water. My beer came out darker than what is pictured (see below), some people strive for that true red coloring, and while this turned out red, it is a bit darker than traditional Irish Red's.","Never judge a book by it's cover, because this Irish Red is amazing",Food,Beverages,Beer,Wine & Spirits,Beer,Grocery,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors.

We thought the Fever-Tree was the best, with Q Tonic second, and Schweppes Tonic a distant third. The Schweppes had a cloying off-taste compared to the other two which we attributed to the high fructose corn syrup which sweetens it. Before we purchased the two premium tonic waters, we thought Schweppes was the best compared to Canada Dry and Seagram's. But the two premium tonic waters were both better. The Q Tonic (sweetened with agave nectar) was less sweet (and lower in calories) than the Fever-Tree (sweetened with cane sugar) and had a distinctly different taste, more subdued compared to Fever-Tree. Both had clean and crisp finishes that were very refreshing. We both thought Fever-Tree had more flavor, especially more citrus flavor, and we preferred it. We will be happy to finish the rest of the case of Q Tonic we bought, but we are going to purchase only Fever-Tree in the future. We prefer gin and tonics with Bombay Sapphire and Tanqueray Gins.

They were not only the most mouth watering concoction I had ever tasted in my life (and I know my Ginger Beers), but they helped me so much in quelling the nausea I am dealing with from doing chemo, as there was so much fresh Ginger in them (almost medicinal for me). A tonic that I could never let myself run out of. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I never did run out, and all was well for a very long time.Everything changed in October 2013 when I received three cases of this once wonderful Ginger Beer. They looked funny, tasted odd, and even bitter, and all shared an expiration date of 7/14. I know this product rather well and knew that something was really wrong here. Whatever spilled into the batches that expire 7/14, all had something in them that simply did not belong. There was no mistaking that something was wrong here. We even had neighbors taste test with us, and they agreed that something was definitely very odd in the ones that we had just received, which all expired 7/14.One of these neighbors owns a home nearby, and as a bartender, knows the Fever Tree mixers well. He said that it was obvious that the factory thought it was still making Tonic Water and let Quinine or whatever makes up tonic, run into these instead of natural spring water, as always used. That would explain the strange and unrecognizable bitterness. All I knew is that I was now stuck with three cases of stuff that tasted awful.I contacted Fever Tree directly to make them aware of this problem, as well as Brands Of Britain, who is the sole, authorized, distributor here in the United States.Read more",This is such a painful review to write.......... 543 of 621 people found this helpful.

First, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to review my Cocktail Artist Premium Manhattan Mix. I am totally humbled and very passionate about bringing you this remarkable product. What I've done is take out the guess work for making an exceptional Manhattan at home. Just use 2 parts whiskey and 1 part CA Manhattan Mix, stir with ice and enjoy...yes it's that easy! By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesn't have any artificial flavors or aftertaste. Try my Manhattan Mix with other Cocktail Artist essential bar ingredients, to easily create a variety of amazing drinks. Use it with our Cocktail Artist lemon juice to make the perfect Whiskey Sour or with our CA Mint Syrup for an amazing Mint Julip. If your not a big fan Whiskey, you can use this with other spirits. Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create.

The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.","Fresh, Natural Mixer for the Perfect Margarita",Food & Beverage,Beverages,Cocktail Mixes,Food,Beer,Wine & Spirits,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1

Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one's drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermen's Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, it's disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material.

Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.",Don't waste your calories,Food,Beverages,Beer,Wine & Spirits,Beer,Party Supplies,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

"Food,Beverages,Beer, Wine & Spirits,Cocktail Mixers","Mr _ Mrs T Margarita Mix, 33.8 oz ()",5.0,"I recently have begun enjoying margaritas. I havent done a lot of searching for different mix and am pretty sure that this one is a good bet. I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.","Great Product, excellent taste!",Food,Beverages,Beer,Wine & Spirits,Cocktail Mixers,,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

"Food,Beverages,Beer, Wine & Spirits,Wine, Beer and Beverage Fridges,Small Wine Cellars",Kalamera 12 Bottle Single Zone Freestanding Wine Cooler,,"We received the unit a few days ago. So far it is as promised. Noise level outside the unit is acceptable--slightly less than your average refrigerator, around 40db in the surrounding area. Fine for a common area of the home. It cooled our wine down from 77 to 55 degrees pretty quickly. We have tried out a couple of thermo-electric units that seems to run for hours upon hours, never quite reaching the desired temperature--so we decided to go with a compressor based refrigerator that has more power and therefore, won't have to run as many hours (and require service/repair as quickly). The cooler looks great as shown. The refrigerant is R600--it is nontoxic--which is a big plus. When it is running, the top of the unit gets hot--so don't put any candles on it! We removed the second-to-last shelf (towards the bottom) to comfortably accommodate our different-sized bottles. We currently have 30 bottles in there, and could fit comfortably 5-7 more (Syrah, Grenache and Burgundy bottles take up more space than standard Bordeaux-type bottles). It is hard to find a good quality, long-lasting wine refrigerator--after much research--hopefully we have found the best one. Time will tell. Finally, I would give five stars for this cooler, however the seller was extremely slow to respond to my product inquiries and is unclear as to the terms of warranty (other companies have stated one year for cooler plus 3 years for compressor, for instance). Hopefully we won't have any problems in the future, in which case I suppose we would have to lean on Amazon to remedy the situation.",So far so good,Food,Beverages,Beer,Wine & Spirits,Wine,Beer and Beverage Fridges,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy.

"Food,Beverages,Beer, Wine & Spirits,Cocktail Mixers,Bitters,Grocery & Gourmet Food,Bottled Beverages, Water & Drink Mixes,grocery","Angostura Orange Bitters, 4 fl oz, ()",,"I have been working my way back to classic cocktail recipes ever since reading David Wondrich's book Imbibe! on the great Professor Jerry Thomas and his cocktail recipes and techniques. A wealth of information there and a beginning of a long journey to try to recreate the cocktail prior to the great disaster called Prohibition. As a martini drinker, I naturally wanted to explore the tastes of the original drink so I began with orange bitters. In my market there were no retailers who carried orange bitters, so I had to rely on the ever more expensive places that will ship the stuff to your door. I started with Fee Brothers orange bitters and then tried the Peychaud version of Gary Regan's orange bitters (no. 6). Finally about 3 months ago a local liquor and wine store chain started stocking the new Angostura orange bitters. Thinking it would be easier and less expensive to support a local merchant and also wanting to try the bitters, I picked up a bottle. I was a little taken aback when I saw the retail price, 11 versus 7 for Fee Brothers and 6 for Regan's. I decided to try it anyway.Upon opening the bottle I realized that the bottle itself was orange colored and the internal contents were virtually colorless. Having made many fruit and peel extractions for liqueurs, I was very suspicious. Forging on I sniffed the aroma from the open bottle. The first smell is definitely orange, with an underlying clove aroma and something cloying behind those aromas that does not seem to work well. In the drink the orange flavor is good and the bitterness that is necessary in a quality bitter is apparent. But it seems to me that it is quickly overwhelmed by something like a passion fruit flavor that definitely does not belong in a martini. I would consider using this product in drinks that have some fruit juice and will experiment some with it. I think wit would compliment a splash of pineapple juice in a drink like the Cobalt, but I would not use it in a martini.",Not ready for prime time,Food,Beverages,Beer,Wine & Spirits,Cocktail Mixers,Bitters,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0

And with the release of Angostura's orange bitters, I believe that the company has created a new standard in that area as well.These bitters are zesty, sharp, and deliver a gigantic orange punch. I am a huge fan of Regan's orange bitters, but where those go off into a deeper, spicier direction, Angostura's offering stays laser focused on orange, orange, and more orange. Brilliant.

As a child, I remember my grandfather and keeping a bottle around. These days, I always have one on hand and so do most of my friends. Recently my local grocery store stopped carrying Angostura regularly so I looked online for it (as almost everything is available online these days) and much to my surprise it was available in original and orange flavor! I haven't yet tried any other brands or flavors of bitters, but I do know that I thoroughly enjoy Angostura orange bitters and will be buying another bottle. In fact, I may have been converted to orange. I find it versatile in that its great for cocktails, non-alcoholic mixers, and flavoring carbonated water such as club soda and seltzer.

They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. I've found with Lucas' Pawpaw, it's only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more.

These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case.

I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites. After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren���t good either. These aren���t wines I���d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The ros�� is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn���t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I���ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the ���wine expert��� repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case. You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

To be honest, I've had cheap wine that is good and more expensive wine that is not good. A good wine to me has a good balance. I actually really really liked the moscato. Moscato is my favorite type of wine and I've had a lot that I don't care for. If you like Bartenura, you will appreciate this. I liked the white zin also. I didn't care for the chardonnay, but my husband said it was ""ok."" I'd like to get the 3 bottle pack that you can choose, but the current price makes the 3 bottle pack more expensive per bottle. I'd say all in all, this is a decent middle of the road group of wines. The moscato impressed me the most. For those who haven't heard of the bartenura comparison, it's a $11-16 bottle, so it puts it right in about the same class as O'Leary. If you're curious about this, if say take a chance.
